        <h2>Webpage:</h2>
        <p>
          https://kymichaelssalon.com/ <br /><br />

          Ky Michaels Salon is a small business on Wickenden Street in
          Providence. Their home page is the first page you see when you click
          on their website. It lists the salon’s hours, address, and other
          important information about the salon. <br /><br />

          Ky Michaels Salon is the salon I go to in Providence to cut my hair,
          but I usually call in because their website is hard to navigate and
          there is no link to book an appointment. I chose to redesign the home
          page to help make the website interaction easier.

        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the responsive redesign project is to improve the
          usability of the Ky Michaels Salon home page through responsive web
          design techniques.
        </p>

        <h2>Usability Issues:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Embedded YouTube video takes up most of the page, making it
            inefficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            Title on the browser tab is not the salon name, making navigation
            harder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Booking an appointment and pricing information are hard to find.
          </li>
          <li>Inconsistent drop-down menus in the header.</li>
          <li>Lack of a "Shop" option and unclear product categorization.</li>
          <li>
            Home page only includes basic information, which can be misleading.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Accessibility Issues:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Webpage is not well-adapted for screen readers.</li>
          <li>Missing alternative text for images.</li>
          <li>Low contrast icons in the footer.</li>
        </ul>
